Recently, I was down for no reason, which made me seeking for the essence of life. why do we live, what do we live for, how should we live, .etc many questions comes to me.

Ocassionally, I read a post in internet by Niel Patel, who wrote like this:

The true essence of life depends on how you look at life. Since you are asking about human life, I'll concentrate on that. I believe that we are a combination of these two broad categories. 

> EOL = x*A+(100-x)*E


EOL = Essence of life
A = Essence of life in the Achievers category
E = Essence of life in the Enjoyers category
x = percentage of how much you agree with the Achievers category

- **Achievers**

The essence of life for such people is to prove themselves to themselves and in a few cases to others. Overcoming obstacles and challenges is what makes life enjoyable for them. They believe that happiness lies in the big things and will always strive to be more successful, sometimes at the cost of their personal lives.

Managing a company
Politics
Solving important world problems


- **Enjoyers**

They believe that the essence in living life is in the small, little things. They tend to do whatever makes them happy. Many might just live an average life in the eyes of others. They believe that happiness is far more important than anything in the world.

They might love:
A walk in the rain
Spending time with family
Reading a book

My 'x' should be 80%, as I care more about how much my behavior contribute to upper organization, even the world.
